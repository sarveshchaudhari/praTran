# Maharashtri Prakrit to English Neural Machine Translation

This project delivers a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** system for converting **Maharashtri Prakrit**, an ancient Indo-Aryan language, into English. With a **Flask web interface** and a model fine-tuned specifically for this low-resource language, it provides an accessible tool for linguistic exploration.

## Project Overview

### Model
This project uses the **M2M100 multilingual model** by Facebook AI, meticulously fine-tuned for the nuances of Maharashtri Prakrit.

#### Key Features
- **Transformer Architecture:** Employs self-attention for robust sequence modeling.
- **Long-range Dependency Handling:** Suitable for the complex structures found in ancient texts.
- **Transfer Learning:** Enhances performance in low-resource scenarios.

### Dataset
To overcome the scarcity of digital resources, we created a **custom dataset of 1,474 parallel sentences** derived from the *GƒÅhƒÅ Sattasaƒ´*, utilizing data augmentation and transfer learning to boost model reliability.

### Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:
- **BLEU score:** 15.34
- **METEOR score:** 0.47
